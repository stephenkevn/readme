# About me

I'm Stephen, a designer and builder based in San Francisco. Currently working at [Nuon](https://nuon. co), a Series A startup, where I design and build technical products for enterprise developers. I love challenging hard problems and pushing the boundaries of what's possible â€” whether that's designing systems, writing code, or creating something entirely new.
